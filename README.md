# [👋] Introduction [👋]
Hello! My internet name is Mieko Hikari. Nice to meet you! I am currently 14 years old who likes to make things but is dry on ideas! I want to be a gaming youtuber and also be a great competitive player!

### [👀] Interests [👀]
I am interested in JPop (I wanna make a song!), Games (like VALORANT, APEX, etc.), people! ;D Maybe we can get to know better? Maybe?

### [🌱] Learning [🌱]
I want to work on Artificial Intelligence and develop a way to converse and feel! Its complicated so I'm just starting out with C++, Node, Assembly.

#### [💞]️ Collab Info [💞]
I like to collaborate with people but make sure you are nice! I am still a minor but I do get kinky jokes ;) As a person, I think I have a shitty personality so I want to change myself! I think collaborations in both gaming and programming can make me a better person!
