# [👋] Introduction [👋]
Hello! My internet name is Mieko Hikari. Nice to meet you! I am currently 15 years old who likes to make things but is dry on ideas! I want to be a gaming youtuber and also be a great competitive player!

### [👀] Interests [👀]
I am interested in JPop (I wanna make a song!), Games (like Scarlet Nexus, League, Shadowverse etc.), people! ;D Maybe we can get to know better? Maybe?

### [🌱] Learning [🌱]
I want to work on Artificial Intelligence and develop a way to converse and feel! Learning Python, JS, CSS and HTML!

#### [💞]️ Collab Info [💞]
I like to collaborate with people but make sure you are nice! I am still a minor but I do get kinky jokes ;) I am trying to improve myself everyday by interacting with people!
